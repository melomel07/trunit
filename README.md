# Trunit

A Lightweight program that runs your Terraria server & Python Discord Bot with Style & Ease!

## How to add Trunit to your server

https://telegra.ph/Trunit-07-04

## How it works

Trunit works by reading the files in the server's folder and opening the server files within the program as well as your python discord bot and playit proxy, via user input commands. It is one of my goals to make the user interface as simple, clean and awesome as possible. I will personally then take notes of any issues you tell me about to improve the program. (as well as all my other projects)
